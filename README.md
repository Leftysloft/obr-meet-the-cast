Extension for Owlbear Rodeo 2 to add a character interaction sheet.
To use this app extension, the character sheet on DnDBeyond **_MUST_** be set to **_public_**.

NOTICE: (22Mar2024) This is best done using the **_OBR Prefab extension_**, as it will store and restore saved data across scenes.

1. Select your characters and creat a new **_Prefab Scene_**.

2. Copy your character ID from the DnDBeyond character sheet.
   **_Your character requires an image for functionality. I am working on a fix_**
